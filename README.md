# Emotion Classification using CNN

 The Role of Emotions in Human Revolution: How Feelings Drive Change

It is no doubt that emotions are a major driving force for human development. Even animals, which have no consciousness, use emotions to determine which actions to take intuitively. Over the last century, humans have acquired a reasonable amount of data on how emotions affect us, to the extent that a field dedicated to the study of emotions, called affective science, has emerged. Over the years, we have listed and categorized over 20 types of emotions, even classifying them as good or bad. This has made me question whether we have done what is needed to master the complexity of emotions.

I believe AI is here to assist humankind in achieving our desired potential for how we want the world to be, as well as equipping us with the necessary programs and algorithms to make more sound decisions. AI's ability to assist us in identifying our emotions can enable us not only to master the complexity of our emotions but also to improve our understanding of each other.

This project involves the use of convolutional neutral network to identify 7 classes of emotion which are listed below. 

 1.Angry
 
 2.Disgust
 
 3.Fear
 
 4.Happy
 
 5.Sad 
 
 6.Surprise
 
 7.Neutral
